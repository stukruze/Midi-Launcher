# Midi-Launcher
A web based program to open files on your computer with midi events

by Stuart Kruze audiolaboratory@hotmail.com

This program current runs in google chrome browser but can work in firefox with proper plug-ins. Research Web Midi API.

You must change a google chrome flag with chrome://flags/ find "Native File System API" and enable.

Additionally you may want to allow popups from this page by going to chrome settings then site settings then popup and redirects and adding the site file:///Users/*your-user-name*/*path-to-file*/midi-launcher.html

If your using the Program Change feature and you want to trigger track 1, send a Program Change message of 0. If you would like to trigger track 2, send a Program Change of 1. And so on.

Attach a midi interface, a midi controller and enjoy.

Any bugs please post.
